__{{config.site.name}}__ is a game that takes place in a world where dogs are the ruling class and cats are treated as lower class citizens.  Luxury items are strictly forbidden, but a black market persists.  You take on the role of a smuggler trying to provide contraband to cats in need.  You travel the world buying and selling items, avoiding police, and hustling to get rich or die trying.
